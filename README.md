# pushmebutton
My first .apk that is just a button to destress
This was my first attempt when I tried "programming"  with APK editor. This is literally a button when you see a single picture that says answers for the question "When to use this?" and after that a button that says "PUSH" and nothing else really. You can click to the button for several times and nothing will happen. I like it because it helps me to destress.
